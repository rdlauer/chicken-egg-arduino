# ID Chicken Eggs with Thermal Images, ML, and Cellular IoT

In this two-part Hackster project, I show how to create a:

- Machine Learning-based IoT solution to detect the presence of a chicken egg 🐣
- ...using images provided by a thermal IR camera 🔥
- ...relaying those inferences to the cloud using a cellular module 📶
- ...and sending an SMS notification if an egg is detected 📲.

**Part one firmware is in the `chicken-images` directory.**

**Part two firmware is coming soon!**
